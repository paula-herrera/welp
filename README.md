# FullStack Review

## Ultimate Goal:
- Create an app the allows the user to add restaurant choices, displays them, and randomly chooses a winner
- User can delete indivdual restaurant choices or all restaurant choices

# If you get stuck...
- Did you install all of your dependencies (npm install/package.json)?
- Did you import/require your data correctly?
- Did you export your data correctly?
- Is your Webpack still running?
- If you're not getting a response in Postman, did you send a response back from your controller?

# Routes Guide
- GET /api/all                retrieves all added restaurants
- DELETE /api/all             deletes all added restaurants
- POST /api/add               allows user to add a restaurant
- DELETE /deleteOne/:id       user can delete one restaurant

## Step 1
- Build out the server in index.js
- Create any other necessary folders and files for your server (HINT: controller, router) and use the Routes Guide to add the necessary routes

## Step 2
- Build out the NoSQL database
- Create a properly formatted schema and use it to set up a new collection in your database
- Make sure there is a connection to the server

## Step 3
- Test all endpoints via [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (HINT: test POST first)

## Step 4
- Build out the noted functions in your front end
- Refer to Routes Guide if you are lost

## Step 5
- Use conditional rendering to display a randomly selected restaurant upon pressing the "Go!" button

## EXTRA CREDIT
- Add a new feature that lets you add friends
- Add dropdown to show which friend is submitting each restaurant and save in database
- HINT: this may require you to build new schemas and/or modify existing schemas
